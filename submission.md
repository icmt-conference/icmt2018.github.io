<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

<p>All contributions will be subject to a rigorous selection process by the international <a title="Organization" href="{{ base }}/organization.html">Program Committee</a>.
Submissions should follow the LNCS format, be in PDF, and include the authors' names, affiliations and contact details. The page limit is determined by the paper category; see below. All contributions will be reviewed by at least 3 program committee members; a selection will take place based on those reviews.
</p>
<p>
We solicit papers in the following categories:
<ul>
<li><strong>Research and application papers</strong> (up to 15 pages). Papers in this category should describe novel and scientifically rigorous contributions to the model transformation field and their validation (for research papers) or report on applications of model-transformation technology, and identify and discuss important lessons learnt (for application papers). Of special interest are experience papers that report on industrial applications of model transformation. 
</li>
<li><strong>Exploratory and tool demonstration papers</strong> (up to 5 pages). Papers in this category should describe new, unconventional approaches that fundamentally challenge established research directions and the current state of practice, but which are at an early stage of investigation (exploratory papers) or novel tools or novel features of state-of-the-art model transformation tools. The published papers will be clearly marked as "exploratory" or "tool demonstration". Supplementary information, which will not be published but may be used in the review, may be provided alongside the submission. For tool paper, some such supplementary information is mandatory, in particular how the demonstration will be carried out, including screenshots and examples, and a link to a 3-10 minutes-long YouTube video that demonstrates the use of the tool.
</li>
</ul>
