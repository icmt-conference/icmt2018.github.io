						<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>All contributions will be subject to a rigorous selection process by the international <a title="Organization" href="http://www.di.univaq.it/diruscio/sites/ICMT2015/?page_id=16">Program Committee</a>. Each paper will be reviewed by at least 3 committee members. All submissions should follow the <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">LNCS format</a>, be in PDF, and should include the authors&#8217; names, affiliations and contact details. Since 2015, ICMT provides a <a href="#mentoring">mentoring scheme</a> through which prospective submitters can obtain early advice on the suitability, structure, and content of their papers.</p>
<p><!-- <strong><u>GENERAL CALL</strong></u> --></p>
<h4>General Call</h4>
<p>Four kinds of submissions are sought:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research papers: Up to 15 pages long.</li>
<li>Application papers: Up to 15 pages long.</li>
<li>Exploratory papers: Up to 10 pages long.</li>
<li>Tool demonstration papers: Up to 7 pages long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Research papers </strong> should describe novel and scientifically rigorous contributions to the model transformation field. Papers should clearly discuss how the results were validated.</p>
<p><strong> Application papers </strong> should report on applications of model-transformation technology and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learnt. Of special interest are experience papers that report on industrial applications of model transformation.</p>
<p><strong> Exploratory papers </strong> should describe new, unconventional approaches related to the topics of interest of ICMT. Papers in this category should describe well-defined research ideas that fundamentally challenge established research directions and the current state of practice, but which are at an early stage of investigation and may not be fully evaluated yet.</p>
<p><strong> Tool demonstration papers </strong> should describe novel tools or novel features of state-of-the-art tools, related to model transformation. Submissions should consist of two parts. The first part, no more than 7 pages, should describe the tool presented (please include the URL of the tool if available). This part will be included in the proceedings. The second part, no more than 5 pages, should explain how the demonstration will be carried out, including screenshots and examples, and a link to a 5-10 minute-long YouTube video that demonstrates the use of the tool. This part will not be included in the proceedings, but will be evaluated.</p>
<p>All papers should be submitted electronically via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icmt2016" target="_blank">EasyChair</a></p>

<h4><a id="mentoring"></a>Mentoring Scheme</h4>
<p>Since 2015, ICMT is providing a mentoring scheme through which prospective submitters can obtain early advice on the suitability, structure, and content of their papers. Through this scheme, senior members of the community (mentors) will provide authors with early feedback to help them align their submissions with the objectives and standards of ICMT. Please note that the mentoring scheme is only available for submissions led by an author who has not been involved in an ICMT publication in the past, and that the mentoring scheme will not interfere with the reviewing process (i.e., papers that have participated in the mentoring scheme will still be reviewed by three committee members in the reviewing phase).</p>
<p>Authors wishing to participate in the mentoring scheme, should submit a draft of their papers by the deadline above via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icmt2016" target="_blank">EasyChair</a></p>
