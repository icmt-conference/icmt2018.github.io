<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Model transformation encompasses a variety of technical spaces, including modelware, grammarware, dataware, and ontoware, a variety of model representations, e.g., based on different types of graphs, and a variety of transformation paradigms including rule-based transformations, term rewriting, and manipulations of objects in general-purpose programming languages, to mention just a few.</span></p>
<p>The study of model transformation includes foundations, structuring mechanisms, and properties, such as modularity, composability, and parameterization of transformations, transformation languages, techniques, and tools. To achieve impact on software engineering in general, methodologies and tools are required to integrate model transformation into existing development environments and processes.</p>

<p><!-- ICMT is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners from all areas of model transformation. This year's edition will feature, besides several peer-reviewed papers, a <a title="ICMT’14 Keynote" href="http://www.di.univaq.it/ICMT2014/?page_id=94">keynote held by Jean Bézivin</a>.
